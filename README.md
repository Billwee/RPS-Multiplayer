# RPS-Multiplayer

Welcome to my Online Multiplayer Rock, Paper, Scissors game.

## Overview

This game is completly responsive to players coming and going. If you're waiting for players to finish up, you can hop right in on the action once someone leaves. While playing you will be informed when it's the other players turn to choose. There is also a counter which tells you how many wins, losses, and ties you currently have.

If you'd like to test the game yourself you'll need to open the webpage in two different browser windows and play as each separate user.

Enjoy and good luck!
